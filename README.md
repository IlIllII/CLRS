# CLRS

## This repository contains tests for all algorithms in CLRS "Intro to Algorithms 3rd Edition".

The idea is that you can use this repository as a companion as you work through the book. When you encounter an algorithm, you can come here, code it up, and run the included tests to see if your implementation is correct.

I will include a readme in each chapter's folder to provide details of how to use the code included therein.

The chapters will include various programming langauges, both for my enjoyment and for learning purposes. Some algorithms and data structures are trivial in some languages. For instance, a list in python is redundant, while a list in C is interesting. We will prefer the interesting implementation.

## Things you will need

1. Python
2. Go
3.
