# CLRS

## This repository contains tests for ~all~ some of the algorithms in CLRS "Intro to Algorithms 3rd Edition".

The idea is that you can use this repository as a companion as you work through the book. When you encounter an algorithm, you can come here, code it up, and run the included tests to see if your implementation is correct.

## Book Contents

The book is divided into 8 parts, with each part containing some number of chapters.

1. Foundations
2. Sorting and Order Statistics
3. Data Structures
4. Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques
5. Advanced Data Structures
6. Graph Algorithms
7. Selected Topics
8. Appendix: Mathematical background

Inside each part's folder you can find a readme outlining the chapters covered as well as individual chapter folders. Inside of each chapter folder is another readme that provides instructions for using the code included therein.
