# Chapter 1

This chapter didn't have any algorithms but it did have a few warmup exercises you can do with a pencil and paper.

I plotted a couple visualizations using python to demonstrate orders of growth. Navigate to this directory in your terminal and run the scripts:

```bash
py e1-2-2.py; py e1-2-3.py
```

Performing this command should build the plots and display them. You may have to install any dependencies you don't have using:

```
pip install xxx
```

Where `xxx` is the dependency in question. When you run the script, your terminal should notify you of missing dependencies.
