# Chapter 3

You lucked out; chapter 3 didn't have any algorithms.

Don't neglect the mathematical preparation in this chapter, you will probably need it for the algorithmic analysis in later chapters.

Leaving this chapter you should, at minimum, know your bounds - big O, little o, theta, omega, etc.
